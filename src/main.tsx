/**
 * The boot sequence. The order is not arbitrary.
 *
 *   1. Observability first, so an exception thrown by anything below is reported rather than lost.
 *      A crash during the first render is the single most valuable event this app can send.
 *   2. `initAnalytics()` second — see the note beside the call.
 *   3. Render last.
 *
 * ── There is no `bootstrapSession()` here, and its absence is the point ────────────────────────
 *
 * Every other frontend in the estate awaits an SSO hand-off before mounting. This one has nothing to
 * hand off: micro-pool reads no bearer token on any route this bundle calls (`pool/src/server.ts` —
 * only its browser-mining ticket route does, and micro-hub-web's `/mine` is what calls that), this
 * bundle has no `lib/auth.tsx`, and there is no estate account behind a mining address. A session
 * bootstrap here would be a network round trip against the identity service, on every page load,
 * whose result nothing in this bundle could read — and it would put a "Sign in" affordance in front
 * of a reader whose entire relationship with this service is a TCP connection from an ASIC. See the
 * header of src/components/shell.tsx.

 * It goes here, before the render, rather than inside a component, because the denied default has to
