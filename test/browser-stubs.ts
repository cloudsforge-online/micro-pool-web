/**
 * The smallest browser these tests need.
 *
 * These stubs are for the PURE layer, which in this repository is host resolution
 * (`src/lib/hosts.ts`), the request wrapper (`src/lib/api.ts`), the response readers
 * (`src/lib/pool.ts`), the formatters and the observability queue. Every one of those is a
 * function, and putting a whole document under a function is pure cost — that layer touches four
 * globals and they are all stubbed below.
 *
 * The COMPONENT layer is a different question and gets a different answer: `test/dom.ts` mounts a
 * real tree in happy-dom, because "the shell says this pool does not pay out even when the API is
 * down" is a statement about a tree after its effects have run and cannot be expressed without a
 * document. The boundary between the two files is written out at the top of that one.
