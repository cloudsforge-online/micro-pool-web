/**
 * The four bytes-on-disk this surface needs of its own, and the mark it deliberately does not have.
 *
 * ── WHY A SEPARATE HOSTNAME NEEDS ANY ASSETS AT ALL ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "A browser tab and a shared link inherit nothing" (`brand/plan.ts`). Favicons are per-origin and
 * an og card is per-URL, so `pool.<apex>` gets a blank tab and a blank link preview unless it
 * carries its own copies — no matter what the apex serves.
 *
 * ── THEY ARE FORGE NETWORK'S, AND THAT IS THE DECISION THIS FILE PINS ─────────────────────────
 *
 * micro-brand has no `pool` set: there is no `brand/assets/pool/` directory and no `pool` entry in
 * the plan. Generating one from a frontend repository is the one place brand assets must never come
 * from, so this surface borrows Forge Network's — the same decision `data-cf-product="network"` in
 * index.html makes, for the same reason: a mining pool is chain infrastructure and belongs to Forge
 * Network rather than being a product of its own. explorer-web reaches the same conclusion.
 *
 * The bytes are compared IN BOTH DIRECTIONS against the sibling checkout, so "copied from brand"
 * stays true rather than becoming "copied from brand once, in March". And the absence of
 * `brand/assets/pool/` is asserted too, so the day micro-brand generates one is the day a test
 * tells somebody to come back here and swap them.
